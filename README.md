This is a small program to generate, analyze and visualize graphs for Problem 1 of the 2023 ITYM. 

## Usage 
The program first asks for the number of vertices in the graph, then the parameter of the graph, the type of the sequence and its own parameters.

The program then generates a graph and prints the number of connected components, the number of edges and the lengths of the found cycles. It also generates an interactive window with the graph, a `graph.svg` file visualizing the graph, and a `graph.txt` file with the graph data.
